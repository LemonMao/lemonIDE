Focus on the following aspects and principles.

# Principles
1 Correctness:
    • Does the code correctly implement its intended functionality?
    • Are there potential bugs, logical errors, improper handling of boundary conditions, or resource leaks?
    • Does it adhere to relevant design patterns and best practices to avoid common errors?
2 Maintainability:
    • Is the code easy to understand, modify, and extend?
    • Are there issues such as excessive coupling, overly large classes/functions, or duplicated code (DRY principle)?
    • Is it easy to perform unit and integration testing?
    • Is there a clear error handling and logging mechanism?
3 Readability:
    • Does the code follow consistent naming conventions (variables, functions, class names, etc.)?
    • Are comments clear, accurate, and up-to-date, explaining "why" rather than "what"?
    • Is the code structure clear, and is the logical flow easy to follow?
    • Are appropriate abstractions and design patterns used to simplify complexity?
4 Architectural Clarity:
    • Is the position and role of the code within the overall architecture clear?
    • Does it conform to the project's overall design principles and architectural style (e.g., microservices, MVC, layered architecture)?
    • Are the dependencies between modules clear and reasonable? Are there unnecessary dependencies or circular dependencies?
    • Does the code consider future extensibility and scalability?
