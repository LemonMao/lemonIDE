Focus on the following aspects and principles.

# Principles
1 Correctness:
    • The code should correctly implement its intended functionality.
    • Avoid potential bugs, logical errors, improper handling of boundary conditions, or resource leaks.
    • Adhere to relevant design patterns and best practices to avoid common errors.
2 Maintainability:
    • The code should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.
    • Avoid issues such as excessive coupling, overly large classes/functions, or duplicated code (DRY principle).
    • The code should be easy to perform unit and integration testing.
    • Provide a clear error handling and logging mechanism.
3 Readability:
    • The code should follow consistent naming conventions (variables, functions, class names, etc.).
    • Comments should be clear, accurate, and up-to-date, explaining "why" rather than "what".
    • The code structure should be clear, and the logical flow should be easy to follow.
    • Use appropriate abstractions and design patterns to simplify complexity.
4 Architectural Clarity:
    • The position and role of the code within the overall architecture should be clear.
    • Conform to the project's overall design principles and architectural style (e.g., microservices, MVC, layered architecture).
    • Dependencies between modules should be clear and reasonable. Avoid unnecessary or circular dependencies.
    • The code should consider future extensibility and scalability.
